# SDL_CUDA C++ Project

## Overview

This project combines SDL3 and CUDA to create a particle physics simulator. SDL3 is used for rendering graphics and handling input, while CUDA accelerates the computation of particle interactions on the GPU, providing high performance for complex simulations.

## Requirements

- CUDA Toolkit
- MSVC C++ Compiler
- CMake

## Building

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `cmake -S . -B build` to generate the build files.
4. Run `cmake --build build` to build the project.

## Running

Execute the compiled binary to run the application.
